## Final Project Goals

It's time to get started on your final projects! Over the course of your time at Maker's you've learned a bunch of of useful skills and it's really important that you keep working on them for the next two weeks.  

Even if your final project looks awesome, if your team's process was poor then it's not going to have been a great outcome for you, and your time spent working on it is likely to be far less enjoyable.

With this in mind, coaches will be looking for a few things from you as a measure of how well your team is working.

### Testing
- [ ] 90% or greater test coverage 
- [ ] Unit tests should 
  - [ ] be isolated and test one piece of your own logic
  - [ ] fail if that logic breaks
  - [ ] pass if it is working
- [ ] You should be able to articulate why any test exists (or does not exist)
- [ ] Every feature should be tested from the user's perspective.

### Good distribution of work
- [ ] Every member of the team should be able to explain, at a high level
  - [ ] why any part of the application exists (what problem it solves)
  - [ ] how any aspect of the application works
- [ ] Every member of the team should have made commits
- [ ] Every completed ticket has a closed/merged Pull Request

### Quality of work
- [ ] Commit messages should be clear and composed of
  - [ ] a single line describing the changes made
  - [ ] a description of the problem it solves with reference to the user
- [ ] Linter should pass on all commits
- [ ] All commits have a low complexity score

### Documentation
- [ ] There is up-to-date documentation: 
  - [ ] a project description
  - [ ] how to install and run it
  - [ ] how to run tests
  
It's also a great idea for your team to keep some sort of record of your learning process.  This could take the form of a blog, a wiki or any other format you like.

## Additional Criteria – Weeks 8 and 9 (Engineering Projects)

- Merging any branch into `master` automatically deploys after passing automated tests.
- All code on `master` is containerized.
- `master` is deployed into production.
