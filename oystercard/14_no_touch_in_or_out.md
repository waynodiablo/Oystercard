# Handling a journey without a touch out

[Back to the challenge map](README.md)

So far we have assumed that our users behave well: they touch in at every station and touch out at every station. However, in real life it's not like this. Sometimes people forget to touch in or touch out. Our code should expect this to happen. This is called an edge case: an unlikely but possible situation.

Discuss with your pair partner what will happen to your journey history right now if a person forgets to touch in or touch out. What will be stored in your journey history?

Right now we are referencing Journey throughout our code. We are talking about journey repeatedly - we are adding journeys, completing journeys and knowing if a journey is incomplete. It is becoming clear that a journey object would be useful. A Journey class is screaming to get out!

Let's create a new Journey class, it should be responsible for starting a journey, finishing a journey, calculating the fare of a journey, and returning whether or not the journey is complete.

```
In order to be charged correctly
As a customer
I need a penalty charge deducted if I fail to touch in or out
```

## Learning Objectives covered
- Use the Extract Class refactoring pattern

## Interview questions you may expect:
- What is an edge case in software engineering? How do you validate code behaviour when an edge case is encountered?
- What is refactoring? When do you refactor code?
- What is the red/green/refactor cycle? Give me an example of using it.
- Explain when you would use Extract Class refactoring pattern and how you would do it.

## To complete this challenge:
- [ ] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [ ] Update your test suite to reflect a new Journey class
- [ ] Create a new class Journey and move the functionality that relates to a journey from Oystercard to Journey
- [ ] Make sure all tests pass, all existing functionality is preserved
- [ ] The `#fare` method should return the minimum fare (for the moment), or the penalty fare of 6 if there was either no entry station or no  exit station.
- [ ] Make sure the entire codebase is DRY
- [ ] Make sure all methods are three lines or shorter

### Hints

  <ul>
    <li>Things get significantly trickier at this point. You'll want to move slowly through this challenge, making sure that you think carefully about what you're doing at each step.</li>
    <li>Right now, the `Oystercard` class is doing far too much. Some of it's behaviour should definitely be moved to the `Journey` class. Before you start, take some time to think about what needs to be moved, and how this will effect your tests and the running of your application. Ensure that you have a plan for what you want to do before you start doing it</li>
    <li>Again, there are many ways to approach this challenge, but it's almost guaranteed that your tests will break as you extract your new `Journey` class. Understand why your tests are failing and fix them one at a time. The key here is to take it slow - extract behaviour piece by piece, fixing errors as you go.</li>
