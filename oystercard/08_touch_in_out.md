Now that we have a card that can be topped up and can be used to spend money, we can make it support touch in/out events.

Let's start with something simple: let the card be aware whether it's being used on a journey or not. If it was used to touch in but the user didn't touch out yet, it'll be "in use".

To close this issue, you'll need to test-drive two methods: `touch_in`, `touch_out` and `in_journey?`. Don't try to write all tests in one go: consider the test that you can write first that will rely on only one method and then write more complex tests.


```
In order to get through the barriers.
As a customer
I need to touch in and out.
```

## Learning Objectives covered
- Set an instance variable
- Update the value of an instance variable
- Write custom attribute accessors
- Use boolean variables
- Use predicate methods
- Use RSpec predicate matchers

## Interview questions you may expect:
- What are instance variables and how they are different from local variables?
- Why some Ruby methods end with a question mark? What are they expected to return?

## To complete this challenge:
- [ ] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [ ] Write tests for `in_journey?`, `touch_in` and `touch_out`
- [ ] Write implementation of these methods that will make the tests pass
- [ ] Use an instance variable to track whether the card is in use
- [ ] Use an RSpec predicate matcher to check if the card is in use
- [ ] Use boolean values to store the state of the card
