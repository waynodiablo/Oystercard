# Create RSpec conventional files

[Back to the challenge map](README.md)

In the previous step, you added `rspec` to your Gemfile. You will be using the RSpec testing framework to test-drive your code throughout this project, so it's important we prepare the project to use RSpec.

Prepare your project for RSpec by creating a helper file and an empty test file. Assume that the name of the class under test that you will create later is `Oystercard`.

## Learning Objectives covered
- Change into directory
- List directory contents
- Create RSpec conventional files
- Create empty files using the command line

## Interview questions you may expect:
- Explain RSpec file and folders naming conventions.
- What do default options in RSpec configuration file mean?
- What do `..` and `.` shortcuts in the command line mean?

## To complete this challenge:
- [ ] Generate conventional files (helper and config) for an RSpec project using a command-line option of the rspec executable file
- [ ] Follow RSpec naming convention for files and folders
- [ ] Create a test file for the Oystercard class without any tests but with a `describe` block (doesn't exist yet)

### Hints

  <ul>
    <li>Everything required in order to complete this challenge should be familiar to you from week one.  First generate the files required to run RSpec tests from your terminal, then set up an empty spec file, describing an Oystercard class.</li>
    <li>Check that everything is working by running 'rspec' from the command-line.  You should see a familiar error message.</li>
  </ul>
