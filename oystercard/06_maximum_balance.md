# Enforce maximum balance

[Back to the challenge map](README.md)

By now you have a card that can be topped up but we want to limit the amount of money that can be stored there. On real Oyster cards the limit is £90, so let's add it to our class too. After you close the issue, it will be impossible to top up the card beyond the limit.

Use test-driven development approach to update the `top_up` method to raise an error if the action would take the card beyond the limit.


```
In order to protect my money from theft or loss
As a customer
I want a maximum limit (of £90) on my card
```

## Learning Objectives covered
- Use interpolation
- Use an inline `if` statement
- Use a constant
- Raise errors
- Access a constant from outside the class
- Check that a statement raises an error with RSpec

## Interview questions you may expect:
- What are exceptions in Ruby? Why do they have messages associated with them?
- How can you check an expression raises an error with RSpec? Why do you have to pass the code as a block to do this?
- What are constants and how are they different from variables? Why use them?
- What does the DRY acronym mean? Why is it important to keep your code DRY?

## To complete this challenge:
- [ ] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [ ] Write a test that checks the `top_up` method throws an exception if the new balance would exceed the limit.
- [ ] Use a constant to store the limit
- [ ] Implement the limit in the top_up method. Use an inline `if` statement to check if the limit would be exceeded
- [ ] Make the error message include the limit value
- [ ] Use interpolation to keep your code DRY

  <ul>
    <li>Remember to check the materials below if you don't remember any of the steps involved here from last week. They contain everything you'll need to complete this stage.</li>
    <li>Once your test is passing, your `top_up` method is likely to have multiple responsibilities - consider refactoring some of this behaviour into a private method.</li>
    <li>You now have two tests for your `top_up` method. Consider using a describe block in your `oystercard_spec` file to keep your tests well organised.</li>
  </ul>
