# Creating the station class

[Back to the challenge map](README.md)

The last issue wasn't easy was it? However, you learned and reinforced quite a few important concepts. You also did some basic refactoring. Finally, you used Ruby data structures – arrays and hashes – to store data, which you will do in pretty much every single Ruby project you'll ever work on.

Right now our card holds the history of all trips made. In our tests we are using a double to represent a station object. Let's create a simple station class that has a name and zone on creation. Once we do this, we'll be able to display zones in the travel history and calculate fares between different zones.

Discuss with your pairing partner different ways – there are several strategies that you could come up with – to add zone information to the list of stations. Implement it using the guidelines below.

```
In order to know how far I have travelled
As a customer
I want to know what zone a station is in
```

## Learning Objectives covered
- create a simple class
- compare Struct vs OpenStruct vs manually building a simple class

## Interview questions you may expect:
- Explain the difference between Struct and OpenStruct - when would you use them?
- What does the DRY acronym mean? Why is it important to keep your code DRY?

## To complete this challenge:
- [ ] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB
- [ ] Test drive the creation of a Station class that exposes a name and a zone variable
- [ ] Write a test that checks that the station now contains information about zone and make it pass
- [ ] Use only one expectation per test
