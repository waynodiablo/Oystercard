# Charging for the journey

[Back to the challenge map](README.md)

When you completed the last challenge, you added the functionality to make sure a card can only be used to touch in if it has enough money for one journey. Now we need to actually charge the card on touch out.

Update the `touch_out` method to reduce the balance by minimum fare.

```
In order to pay for my journey
As a customer
I need to pay for my journey when it's complete
```

## Learning Objectives covered
- Use RSpec to check that code changes a variable
- Use private methods to maximise encapsulation

## Interview questions you may expect:
- Why would you use curly braces to pass a block of code to the `expect` method in RSpec?

## To complete this challenge:
- [ ] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [ ] Write a test that uses `expect {}.to change{}.by()` syntax to check that a charge is made on touch out.
- [ ] Update the `touch_out` method to make the test pass
- [ ] Make '#deduct' a private method
- [ ] Keep the code DRY
