# Solution – Sinatra: Using the Chrome DevTools

[Back to the Challenge](../15_sinatra_using_the_chrome_devtools.md)

The Chrome DevTools are an extra string to your debugging bow. They will give you extra insight in to the flow of information through your application - insight that you can use to identify where things are going wrong, and fix them.

While there is no formal 'solution' to this exercise, do read the - [Chrome DevTools documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools).

> We won't explicitly refer to the DevTools any more this week. Instead, the challenges expect you have the DevTools open any time you are using your browser.

Once you are satisfied you know how the DevTools work, let's move on.
