# Attacking Player 2

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

We now have a couple of implemented User Stories, and a handy helper. Let's implement another User Story:

```
As Player 1,
So I can win a game of Battle,
I want to attack Player 2, and I want to get a confirmation
```

In this challenge, you will implement this user story with little support. You should use the helper you wrote in [Challenge 21](21_test_helpers.md) to keep things DRY.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Write a feature test using Capybara
- Pass a feature test using Capybara

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Write a feature test for the User Story above
- [ ] Pass this test with minimal implementation.
