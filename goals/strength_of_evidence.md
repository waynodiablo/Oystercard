# Strength of evidence

One of our most important jobs is to support you in getting an accurate picture of your own progress. When we ask you for evidence, we ask you to tell us whether it is weak, moderate, or, strong evidence. It's okay to start with weak evidence, but you should be looking for stronger and stronger evidence as time goes by.

This is summed up in the acronym CEP, standing for:

* Credible
* Empirical
* Personal

**Weak evidence is personal.** It's based on your personal feelings, thoughts, or impressions of an event.

**Moderate evidence is empirical.** It's based on things like written or quoted feedback, your verified capability to apply a skill through actually doing it, events where you have demonstrated competence, code that works, following a process correctly, etc.

**Strong evidence is credible.** It's empirical evidence backed up by expertise or events that couldn't reasonably mean anything else. For example, if you explain a topic to a beginner and then they can apply it straight afterwards, that's credible.

Coaches are also a good source of credible feedback, as software engineering experts. Be mindful of the questions you ask them though! Are you looking for evidence that you're making progress? Or evidence that your code is of a professional standard?
