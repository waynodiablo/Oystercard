# Recipe: I know how my language works

We'll focus on debugging today, as a method of understanding more about a program so you can fix it.

## Getting started

* **10:30** - [Debugging skills workshop](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-1/debugging_1)
* [Debugging approaches practical](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/debugging/debugging_approaches.md). Feel free to start this whenever you like, and/or:
* **10.30** An informal session on floor 3 at for a group to work through the exercises from the practical.
* An exercise on [debugging with Pry](https://learn.co/lessons/debugging-with-pry).

## Challenging yourself

* Go through a program you've written and put a comment on every line explaining what it does. Go through it with someone and see if they agree.
* As above, but with a program you haven't written. You won't understand it all immediately — that's okay! Try the [Geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder) gem.
