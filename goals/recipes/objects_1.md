# Recipe: Objects 1

## Project

[Test drive a notes app](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/neoeno/projects/13)

This is a good project to start with to learn test driven development and start with object oriented design.

## Supporting materials
* **10.00: Encapsulation** A workshop on encapsulation, an important principle of object oriented design.
* [Encapsulation Practical](https://hackmd.io/2yBI8-9vTwm4u-5c5Q4tsg). Another set of exercises focusing on encapsulation.
* [Encapsulation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)). Note that much of this will seem complicated! One of your key advantages as a developer is being able to sift the useful information out of resources like this.
* Go through every line of your code, leaving a comment explaining what it does. Ask someone to read it and discuss points where their understanding agrees or differs.
