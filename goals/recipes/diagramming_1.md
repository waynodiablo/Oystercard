# Diagramming 1

Pick your own focus goal. Diagramming is helpful everywhere!

## Getting started

* **10.10: [Domain model diagramming skills workshop](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-2/domain_model_diagramming)**. This workshop guides you through generating domain model diagrams from user stories, then writing code.
* [Diagramming Practical](https://hackmd.io/KJS8ssY2RaWXp2KfnYST-w). This guides you through different ways of diagramming code, then works through to diagramming user stories. Coaches will be around to help you check your work.
* Diagram out Boris Bikes, Airport, Student Directory.
* **Various times: Group Code Review**. Get feedback on your airport challenge and put it into practice immediately. Sign up here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z3RxmbATtIb3SHbnv7J0FmWhbqAhmfDSS_8QkETHLsk/edit#gid=1414142282
* [Airport challenge exemplar video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg0cFVLH_EM). A big favourite with previous developers!

## Challenging yourself
* [An introduction to UML](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/769.html)
