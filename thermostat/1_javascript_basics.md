# JavaScript Basics

[Back to the Challenge Map](0_challenge_map.md)

A new language means a new environment. So far, you've been used to using IRB or Pry to try out small code experiments and load your own files. However, this week, the focus is on browser-based (also known as client-side) JavaScript, which means that you'll need to get familiar with some new tools.

In this challenge, you will learn to interact with the JavaScript REPL, create a basic object with a method and write a simple function.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Describe JavaScript as a scripting language built for the web
- Understand JavaScript's role in the browser ecosystem
- Use the Chrome console as a REPL
- Understand JavaScript language conventions

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Find the Chrome DevTools Console
- [ ] Write your first "Hello world!" using `console.log()`
- [ ] Understand the difference between **literal** and **constructor** notation when creating objects
- [ ] Create a `Greeting` object with a method `hello(person)`, which will output "Hello, Maker!" when you type `greeting.hello("Maker")`
- [ ] Create a `hi` function which will output "Hi, Maker!" when you type `hi("Maker")`
- [ ] Experiment with the following basic language features: strings, numbers, arrays, objects. This point may seem trivial but there are some very important differences between Ruby and Javascript!
- [ ] Ensure all your code follows [basic JavaScript conventions](/pills/js_conventions.md)
- [ ] Discuss the difference between client-side (browser) and server-side with your pair partner
- [ ] Discuss why JavaScript is the "language of the Web"
