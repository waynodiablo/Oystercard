# Thermostat: business logic

[Back to the Challenge Map](0_challenge_map.md)

Alrighty. Now that you've got the basics under your fingers, it's time for a new domain.

In this challenge, you will build the logic needed to model a simple thermostat.

### Challenge setup

Specification:

* Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
* You can increase the temperature with the up button
* You can decrease the temperature with the down button
* The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
* If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
* If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
* Power saving mode is on by default
* You can reset the temperature to 20 by hitting the reset button
* The thermostat should colour the display based on energy usage - < 18 is green, < 25 is yellow, otherwise red

### Learning Objectives covered
* Use Jasmine to Test-Drive Development of a thermostat

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:
- [ ] Translate the first specification into a test
- [ ] Pass the test
- [ ] Translate the next specification
- [ ] Repeat until you've run out of tests
