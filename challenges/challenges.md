# Challenges

These are some extra challenges you may want to take on to test your skills and understanding. Some of them are smaller, whereas some of them are full fledged projects that might take you a whole week of extra time to finish ( _a great way to spend the evenings or weekends if you have finished all the work you need to do_ ).
