# Recursion

## Sum of an array

Write a recursive method to find the sum of all elements of an array:

````ruby
def sum(array)
  # for you to implement
end
````

To understand how to write it, answer the following questions:

- What would be the sum of the array if you knew the sum of all values but one?
- What would be the sum of an empty array?
- What would be the base case for this method?

Write tests first:

````ruby
it "computes the sum of an empty array" do
end

it "computes the sum of an array with one element" do
end

it "computes the sum of an array with many elements" do
end
````

## Palindrome

Write a recursive function that determines whether an array is a palindrome. Use the same approach as the previous exercise (tests, base cases).
