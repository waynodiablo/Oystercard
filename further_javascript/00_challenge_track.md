# Challenge track

There is some structure to guide you on this track.

You'll work in pairs as usual, swapping pairs each day.

## Structure of the week

### Group code reviews

We'll have group code reviews at 10am on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  These will last 30 minutes.  The format will be similar to the Monday weekend challenge code reviews.

### Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday

Build a to do list app as a frontend, single page web app.  You'll be guided through this by the high-level challenges listed below.  However, there will be no walkthroughs.

To get an idea of what you'll be building, here are some [user stories and a mockup](notes_app_user_stories.md) for the to do list app.  (This is just to give you an idea of the app.  You'll work through the challenges below to build it.)

#### Challenges

1. [TDD a model for a note](01_note_model.md)
2. [TDD a model for a list of notes](02_note_list_model.md)
3. [TDD a note view that outputs a note list model as HTML](03_note_list_view.md)
4. [Spike creating and serving an `index.html` page for your app](04_index_page.md)
5. [Spike code that inserts some HTML into the `index.html` page](05_insert_html_into_page.md)
6. [Spike and test code that shows a note in the `index.html` page](06_display_note_list.md)
7. [TDD a note view](07_note_view.md)
8. [Use TDD to show only the first 20 characters of each note on the main note list page](08_show_abbreviated_notes_in_note_list_view.md)
9. [Use TDD to finish the implementation of a single note page](09_finish_single_note_page.md)
10. [Spike adding a form to `index.html` for creating a note](10_create_note_form.md)
11. [Spike to intercept a form `submit` event emitted by the create note form](11_intercept_submit_event.md)
12. [Spike to extract note text from a form `submit` event](12_extract_note_text_from_submit_event.md)
13. [Use TDD to finish support for user note creation](13_user_create_note.md)
14. [Refactor](14_refactor.md)

### Thursday and Friday

Build a [frontend, single page web app that summarises the news](news_summary_project.md).  No challenges.  No walkthroughs.  You'll be able to build on what you've learnt from making the to do list app.

#### Guidance

Make sure to look at this [guidance](single_page_app_guidance.md) for the news summariser app!  It'll help you point yourself in the right direction when you're figuring out how to implement some of the trickier things. (The guidance shouldn't be necessary for the to do app.  The challenges will guide you with that.)
