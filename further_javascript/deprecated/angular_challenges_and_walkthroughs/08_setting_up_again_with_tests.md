# Setting up again with tests

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

Congratulations, you've now completed your spike! However, now you've used your
spike to explore the design of the Todos app, its time to delete your spike and
rebuild the app, test-first.

Doing it again this time with tests will give you the opportunity to really
consolidate what you learnt building it in your spike, and allow you to now
focus more fully on understanding how to test a front-end JavaScript framework.

This time around we're going to set it up using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) to manage
our dependencies.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Use npm and bower to install Angular
- Understand the difference between npm and bower

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Start from scratch creating a completely new repository
- [ ] Use npm to install bower
- [ ] Use bower to install angular into a folder called `app`
