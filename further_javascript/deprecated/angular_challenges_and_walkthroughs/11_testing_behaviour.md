# Testing viewing and adding multiple ToDos

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

So far we've been testing some pretty trivial things. This challenge will get
you to start test-driving some of the more complex functionality you were
introduced to in [Challenge 4](04_more_than_one_thing.md) and [Challenge
5](05_controller_expressions.md).

Don't forget for each feature you'll need to write both feature/e2e tests using
Protractor and unit tests using Karma.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Testing multiple elements on a page
- Testing expressions and page interactions

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Test for finding two ToDos on the page, and change your controller so that
  it is initialised with two ToDos, one completed and one not completed, as you
did in [Challenge 4](04_more_than_one_thing.md)
- [ ] Test adding a new ToDo
- [ ] Test removing a ToDo
