# Setting up Karma and writing unit tests

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

Now we've got feature tests covered with Protractor, we need to get angular set
up to work with unit tests. For that we'll use Karma and write a simple unit
test for our TodoController.

Remember you can go back to your spike to see how you built the first version of
your app to help you write your tests.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Install Karma
- Write unit tests using Karma
- Inject dependencies into unit tests

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Create a failing Protractor test that looks on the page for a todo called "Todo1"
- [ ] Install Karma using npm
- [ ] Test-drive building a  TodoController, that tests that it
  gets initialised with a todo called "Todo1"
- [ ] Get the feature test passing by wiring together your angular app
