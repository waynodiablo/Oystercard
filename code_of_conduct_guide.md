# Code of conduct guide

Our [code of conduct](http://www.makersacademy.com/code-of-conduct) explains how we expect people in the Makers Academy community to behave.  It exists because we want everyone to be able to focus on learning and not be distracted by discrimination or harassment.

If there's anything you don't understand about the code of conduct or how it's used, please don't hesitate to ask a member of staff.

## If you experience a code of conduct transgression

Either [call it out](#calling-out-a-code-of-conduct-transgression) or [report it](#reporting-a-code-of-conduct-transgression).

### Calling out a code of conduct transgression

If you feel comfortable doing so, you can say something directly to the person who transgressed the code of conduct.  This can be in public or private.

#### In public

This is best for minor transgressions where you expect that the person just made an mistake.  For example:

Person A: "Explain it to me in a way that my mum would understand". Person B: "That's subtly sexist." Person A: "Sorry, I wasn't thinking." Person B: "That's OK."

If the person doesn't understand why what they said transgresses the code of conduct, or they argue back, it's often best to end the discussion.  In this case, report incident to a member of staff.

#### In private

Here, you give feedback on what the person did that transgressed the code of conduct, and why it hurt you.  It's probably best to only choose this option if you feel confident that the other person will be receptive to your feedback.

### Reporting a code of conduct transgression

Choose the option below that makes you feel the most comfortable.  All reports are kept confidential.

After you make a report, you'll have a conversation with a member of staff.  You'll talk through the incident.  And you'll decide together what to do next.  This might be a conversation mediated by the staff member between you and the person.  Or if might mean the staff member speaking to the person on your behalf.  Whichever it is, the member of staff will support you.

#### Reporting a trasgression by speaking to a member of staff

This can be your coach, or another member of staff you feel comfortable with.  Either message them over Slack or speak to them in person.

#### Reporting a trasgression by filling out the report form

The form is [here](https://makersacademy.typeform.com/to/obuvVk).

## How code of conduct transgressions are handled

Very roughly speaking, we categorise code of conduct transgressions into three groups.

### Minor transgression

For example:

Person A: "Explain it to me in a way that my mum would understand". Person B: "That's subtly sexist." Person A: "Sorry, I wasn't thinking." Person B: "That's OK."

Besides being called out, or having a talk with a member of staff, no further action is taken.

If person A gets called out and doesn't understand why, they can apologise, then speak to a member of staff to understand more.

It's a medium transgression if person A argues back.

### Medium transgression

For example, the person says, "Women are stupid".  Or they make a minor transgression and argue back when called out.

A staff member will give the person a formal warning.  If they make a second medium transgression, they will be told to leave Makers permanently.

### Severe transgression

An illegal or trust-breaking act.

The person will be told to leave Makers permanently.
