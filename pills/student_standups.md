# Student standups

## Goal

* To share information between people who are working together.

## How does a standup work?

* A group of people working together meet at the same time every work day.
* Each person gives a 30 second status report about their work.
* Any questions or discussion happen after the standup has finished.

## Student standups at Makers

* Standups happen on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.
* Your coach will let you know which standup group you are in and what time it meets.

## What to say at a standup

In most standups, people report what they worked on yesterday and what they plan to work on today.  However, since Makers is about learning, in our student standups, each person reports:

* What they learned in the last 24 hours.
* What they plan to learn in the next 24 hours.
* What they struggled with in the last 24 hours.

## Coaches at standups

* Coaches will attend your standups for the first three weeks of the course.  After that, you'll continue to meet, but without coach attendance.

## Minutes

* Normally, minutes aren't taken at a standup.  However, to support your learning, it will help to have a record of what people said.  Please allot someone to take brief notes on people's learning reports.  Commit and push the notes to the [standup minutes repo](https://github.com/makersacademy/student_standup_minutes/) using the format described in the repo README.md.
