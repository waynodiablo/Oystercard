# A guide to building your community

**You don't build your community to get a job.  You build your community to become a great developer.  But, if you build your community, you'll also find it easier to get a job.**

## What is the employer looking for?

Use this question to guide you at every stage of the job hunting process.

Employers are looking for good developers.  Someone who has a developer community is more likely to be a good developer.

## Reasons to build your community

* You'll learn and contribute to the most cutting-edge technologies that will make the developer community more productive.

* You'll share techniques and build skills with other practitioners.

* You'll find open source projects to contribute to.

* You'll find people to collaborate with.

* You'll build friendships.

* You'll become a better developer by osmosis. A person cares about the same things as the people around them.  Caring about something means you think about it more and do it more.  This makes you better at it.

* You'll go deeper into the areas of software development that interest you.

* You'll find role models to learn from and you'll become role models for other people.

* You'll find mentors who can help guide your growth and you'll mentor others.

* You'll be able to get and give feedback on code.

The overall approach is to find ways to contribute to the community.  By contributing, you'll also benefit.

## Types of community you can join

### Meetup

* **What is it?** Regular meetings where people interested in a particular technology or development-related interest gather to socialise.  Sometimes, there are talks preceding the socialising.

* **What are some examples?** [London Ruby User Group](http://lrug.org/), [London Indies](http://www.londonindies.com/) game developer meetup, [London Software Craftsmanship Community](https://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/).

* **How do I join?** Register, then go.

* **How do I contribute?** Talk to people.  Ask them what they're working on.  Ask them how they approach their discipline. Just hang out in a low pressure way.

### Mentoring meetup

* **What is it?** A meetup where newer programmers pair with, or get code review from, more experienced developers.

* **What are some examples?** [Codebar](https://codebar.io/).

* **How do I join?** Sign up either to mentor or be mentored.

* **How do I contribute?** The best way to contribute is by signing up as a mentor.  For example, many Makers mentor at Codebar.

### Makers Academy

* **How do I contribute?** Remain active on Slack.  Mentor newer Makers.  Come to meetups.  Stay connected to your cohort.  Work on projects with other Makers.

### Hackathon / Game jam

* **What is it?** An event that lasts a few days where people make a small product in teams.  Teams usually decide what to build and then build it.  There's often a theme for the projects to follow.  The atmosphere is quite intense because teams try to write as much code as possible in the time available.  Some hackathons awards prizes for the best projects.  Some hackathons happen in person at an event space.  Others happen remotely.

A game jam is the same, but for making video games.

* **What are some examples?** [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/), [Mozilla Fest](https://mozillafestival.org/).

* **How do I join?** Register and go!

* **How do I contribute?** Build a project.

### Slack community

* **What is it?** Most popular languages and frameworks have a Slack community where the users hang out.  These communities are a great place to get help.  They are a great place to get to know the well-known members of the community that has built around the language or framework.  They are great for learning to contribute to a project.

* **What are some examples?** [Ruby on Rails Link](http://www.rubyonrails.link/), [iOS developers](https://ios-developers.io/).

* **How do I join?** Sign up.

* **How do I contribute?** Read, ask questions, answer questions.

### IRC community

Basically the same as Slack communities, but via a different communication medium.

### News aggregator

* **What is it?** A site where users post links to things they find interesting.  Usually, the links are centred on a particular topic.  Users of the site vote up and comment on the links they like.

* **What are some examples?** [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) (focused on startups and development), [Programming Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/).

* **How do I join?** Sign up.

* **How do I contribute?** Post links you find interesting.  Get involved with the discussion in the comments.

### GitHub repository

* **What is it?** Almost every medium-sized and large language, framework and library has a GitHub repo.  Often, development of the technology happens via pull requests on that repo.

* **What are some examples?** [Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby), -Your favourite library-.

* **How do I join?** Join GitHub.

* **How do I contribute?** Here are some ideas.  Read the code in the repo.  Read previous pull requests to see what code changes have been made and how they were discussed.  Read through the issues and see if there are any you think you could fix.  Message the developers for help if you get stuck.

### [Twitter](https://twitter.com)

* **How do I contribute?** Follow people who you admire.  Reading their updates can be a great way to learn.  You can reply to their updates, and it's possible to build a relationship this way.  You can also post your own updates and, over time, gather a following.

### One-to-one connection

* **What are some examples?**  A friendship, a working relationship, or just someone you meet and talk to.

* **How do I join?** Get to know the colleagues you can learn from or learn with. Make friends with developers.  Talk to people at meetups and in online communities.  Collaborate on projects.

* **How do I contribute?** Discuss and explore ideas to understand them better.  Collaborate on projects to learn together.  Give and get code review.

### Company

The company you work for is one of the most powerful communities you can belong to.  It's very important to choose one that you can contribute to, and where you can learn.  It's a community where you'll spend a lot of time, where you'll work on varied projects, where you'll get feedback, where you'll try to achieve a goal, and where you'll be constantly discussing new ideas.

### [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

* **How do I contribute?** Ask and answer questions.  Both can be a little scary because people on the site can sometimes react a little harshly to questions or answers they see as wrong or misguided.  However, after a few tries, you'll learn the conventions and it will stop being scary.  It's worth it because being able to ask and answer questions is a great way to learn.

### Hackspace

* **What is it?** A building or room where people gather regularly to work on software and hardware projects.

* **What are some examples?** [London Hackspace](https://london.hackspace.org.uk/)

* **How do I join?** Register, and possible pay a subscription fee.

* **How do I contribute?** Talk to other people there about what they're working on.  You may find projects you can contribute to.  Work on your own stuff there.  Just being there contributes to the community.

### Conference

* **What is it?** A place where people gather for a few days to hear talks and socialise.  Conferences usually have a theme.

* **What are some examples?** [EuroClojure](http://euroclojure.org), [JSConf EU](https://jsconf.eu), [Barcamp London](http://barcamplondon.org).

* **How do I join?** Register and go.  Or submit a talk proposal.

* **How do I contribute?** Talk to people.  Ask them what they're working on.  Ask them how they approach their discipline. Just hang out in a low pressure way.  Or submit a talk and it might get accepted.  This is a great way to meet people.

### Project

* **How do I contribute?** Start a project.  Ideally, do it with friends so you can learn together.
