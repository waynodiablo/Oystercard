# SublimeText

SublimeText is the editor we recommend you use at Makers Academy. Download the beta version 3 from the official website and install it. It's free to evaluate but you should buy a license if you want to use it after Makers Academy.

Copy-paste the entire key including the "begin license" and "end license" lines and use it to register SublimeText on your machine.

## SublimeText shortcut

It's very convenient to set up a symlink (shortcut) to use SublimeText from the command line. Use the instructions of SublimeText website (you may need to use `sudo` mode to create a symlink in "~/bin"). If all of that sounds cryptic, wait until you finish Command-Line tutorial: it will explain what's going on here.

These instructions are specific to the version 3 of SublimeText, so make sure you have the latest version.

The website advises you to create a shortcut (symlink) in ~/bin but it may not work out of the box on most machines. Try creating the shortcut in /usr/local/bin/ instead (create the directory if necessary).
