# The Escalation Process

You're stuck on a problem.  Below is a list of possible ways to find a solution.  Work through them in order.

At Makers Academy, you're learning to learn.  This is why the list below prioritises techniques that aid self-reliance and skill-building.  But, as a developer, it's expected that you ask for help when you need it.  So, the list also includes ways to get help from others, too.

## The Process

1. If you're stuck on a bug, follow the process in the [debugging](./debugging.md) :pill:.

2. Come up with a clear description of the problem you're having.  "It's broken" is not a problem description.  To help you produce a clear description:
  * Make a list of words that feel related to the problem.
  * Gather information from any errors you're getting.

3. *Pair Partner.* Bounce ideas off them, discuss, and [rubber-duck debug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). Imagine you are seeing the problem for the first time.

4. *Google.* Research the problem using the description you created in step 1.

5. *Diagram.* Draw boxes and arrows, or whatever you like.  Get ideas out of your head and onto paper.  This makes it be easier to manipulate, examine and generate ideas.

6. *Slack Overflow* Post a [Slack Overflow](https://github.com/makersacademy/slack-overflow) issue.  Or

7. *Coach.* If all else fails, get some 1-1 help. This help may come in the form of more questions!
