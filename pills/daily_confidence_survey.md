# Daily confidence survey

At the end of each day, your coach will send out on Slack a few questions that ask you how confident you're feeling about a certain skill or behaviour.  For example, "How confident do you feel about debugging?".

You answer by clicking an emoji that represents one of four different answers:

* :futurama: - Not got to this, yet
* :red_circle: - Not confident
* :large_orange_diamond: - Somewhat confident
* :green_apple: - Confident

The questions will change each week to fit the part of the course you're in.

## How to get the most out of the daily confidence questions

* Analyse how your answers to a single question change from day to day.  Is your confidence decreasing, staying the same or increasing?

* Reflect on why your confidence is changing in the way it is.  You can do this privately or in your daily feedback.

* Reflect on how you could increase your confidence in areas you feel it could be improved.
