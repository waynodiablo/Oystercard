## What is a good idea for a final project?
There are many ways for a final project to stand out. Usually a great final project hits 1 or more of the following criteria:
    
- **The product solves a real problem**
    - What kind of person would use your application? Have you actually asked them? Why would they use your application? What value would they get out of it? Why would they not prefer other existing solutions? Keep asking questions like this!
    - Doesn’t mean that any money has to be made off the back of it.
    - How will you communicate the usefulness of your final project?  
</br>
- **The product is technically interesting**
    - Solves a technically difficult problem.
