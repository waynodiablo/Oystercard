## GitHub collaboration

You can use the approach below to collaborate with your pair on the weekly challenges. Commits made using this approach are counted by GitHub as contributions (green squares on your profile).

1. Pair partner Alice creates a repo on their computer.  For example, `boris-bikes`.

2. Alice makes a commit.

3. Alice creates a `boris-bikes` repo on GitHub.

4. Alice pushes her commit to her GitHub repo.

5. Alice invites pair partner Bob as a [collaborator](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/) on her GitHub repo.

6. Bob accepts the invitation.  (This is important - it lets Bob get his green contribution squares.)

7. Bob clones (not forks) Alice's repository.

8. Bob can add commits to his clone and push them to Alice's GitHub repo.

### The next day

1. Bob is now working with a new pair partner, Chetna.

2. Bob creates a `boris-bikes-2` repo on his GitHub account.

3. Bob changes the `origin` remote on his local clone from the day before to point at his `boris-bikes-2` repo on GitHub.

4. Bob can now push new commits from his clone to `boris-bikes-2`.

5. Bob adds Chetna as a collaborator.  She can now clone and contribute to his repo.
