Encapsulation
=============

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

Encapsulation is the term for ensuring that an object's internal state is not accessible to other objects directly, but rather is manipulated by the object's public interface.  The idea is that knowledge of an object's potentially complex internals is not necessary in order to interact with it effectively.
