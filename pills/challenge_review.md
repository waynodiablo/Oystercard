# Weekend challenge review

After attempting a weekend challenge, the next step is to review and reflect on the work. We use a code and concept review process to facilitate this reflection and to help you to get better at analysing your own code.

Code review is a process where you and your peers review your code, share approaches and identify strategies. The ability to review, assess and improve code is a key developer skill in industry.

Concept review is a where a coach will look to provide additional insight; exploring themes, identifying patterns and discussing the merits of different approaches. Concept review should both aid your understanding of the core concepts of the course and help you to identify areas where additional work is needed.   

## Monday Morning - Code Review

### Goals

- To facilitate knowledge sharing throughout the cohort
- To help you build your own framework for analysing code and ability to apply it
- To give you additional insight into application of concepts introduced as part of the main curriculum

### Pair review (30 minutes)

Aim to arrive between 9.30am and 10am. Get together in your pairs and spend around 30 minutes reviewing each others code according to the rubric for that weekend. The rubric can usually be found in the git repository for the original challenge.

Try to identify 1 to 3 things to discuss with your partner and aim to come away from that discussion with 1 to 3 things you would like to improve about your code or discuss with your group.

Skills:
- Reading and analysis of code
- Identification of development patterns and strategies
- Communication of technical ideas

### Group review (30 minutes)

Following your peer review, get together in small groups. Groups will consist of 4 to 6 students; a coach will post group allocations in the slack channel before 10am.

Share with the group the things you want to explore from the weekend challenge. Try to identify either (a) somebody who can help you with your doubts or (b) somebody you can help with theirs (be generous - helping others level up is both a key skill in itself and something which will help you consolidate your own knowledge). Break off into subgroups accordingly.

When discussion has finished, identify up to 3 questions, concepts or doubts that your group would like to explore with a coach. *Send your list to a coach*. The coach collating the review feedback will make themselves known on the morning.

Skills:
- Communication of technical ideas
- Prioritisation
- Collaboration and leadership

### Refactor (30 minutes)

Based on the feedback you have received, identify at least 1 refactor that you can make to your weekend to challenge to improve it. Attempt a 20 to 30 minute refactor cycle, (if you have more than 30 minutes, attempt 2).

Remember that any development cycle should be short and if you aren't able to complete a refactor in this time you should consider whether you are simplifying effectively. If you have trouble with this, ask a coach about the Process Cards, which can help you think more clearly about this.

Ensure that you have submitted a pull request for your weekend challenge to the main repository. In the description for your pull request, add a comment describing (a) up to 3 things that you thing went well and (b) up to 3 things that you think you would like to do better.

Skills:
- Prioritisation
- Application of technical feedback
- Effective simplification of approach

## Monday Afternoon (and potentially during the week) - Concept Review

### Concept workshops

Once the questions have been submitted to the coach organising the concept review, they will arrange for some focussed group sessions to address the most relevant themes. These slots will typically be 30 minutes to an hour long.

An effort will be made to do these sessions as early as possible; scheduling may mean that they sometimes take place later in the week.

### Additional reading material

If the coach receives your list of questions they may send out reading material in advance of the coach session. Familiarise yourself with it.

## Feedback!

We're always looking to improve our processes! If you have any feedback, please let us know.
