# Resources to help you with your learning

Now that we have your attention, here is a list of great websites and resources that you should be reading: 

## Great websites and resources that you should be reading

Finally, the part of the guide you've been waiting for. Or maybe not.

### Panda

As a lazy developer, you may not want to go out and find stuff to read every day. Luckily, there is a Chrome extension called [Panda](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/panda-4-news-inspiration/haafibkemckmbknhfkiiniobjpgkebko?utm_source=gmail) that brings it all to you every time you open a new tab. Once you have it installed, one recommended configuration is to have it open with Hacker News/Lobsters on the left and right, and Dribble in the middle. If you see something that tickles your fancy, click on it - if you don't understand something in any given article, ask all of the people listed above to explain it to you - you'll be amazed how much new stuff you can learn in a very short space of time. If you don't like installing Chrome extensions or are happy with your current new tab, these are the news sites mentioned above:

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
- [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/)
- [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) (no code, but inspirational)

### Useful blogs

Again, please submit any further suggestions as pull requests. This selection represents blogs and websites that show a dedication to awesome code - if you keep reading them, you are bound to absorb the awesomeness through pure osmosis.

- [Thoughtbot's Playbook](http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/) - Thoughtbot (the people behind some truly awesome projects such as Hound, Factory Girl, Paperclip and Bourbon) open sourced their entire company handbook. The answer to many of your questions, both now and as you grow as a developer (or even a business owner or any other role in tech) is probably in here.
- [Giant Robots Smashing into Other Giant Robots](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/) - The accompanying blog. If you start reading only one thing from this list, choose this.
- [Engine Yard's blog](http://blog.engineyard.com/) - These guys have a lot of great stuff on Ruby, as well as a lot of content related to deployment (which would make sense, seeing as their main business is PaaS - Platform as a Service)
- [eLabs](http://elabs.se/) - the people behind Capybara. They want to help you write better Capybara/Cucumber tests, as well as better Ruby.
- [GitHub engineering blog](https://github.com/blog/category/engineering) - This one explains itself.
- [Sandi Metz's blog](http://www.sandimetz.com/blog/) - Ruby and TDD guru!
- [Martin Fowler's Blicki](http://martinfowler.com/) (yes, it's a thing) - because at some point you'll want to know [the difference between a mock and a stub](http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html),  [refactoring](http://refactoring.com/catalog/) techniques from the man who wrote the book on it, and what to say when you're asked about [microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html). 

At this stage, you may notice that a lot of these blogs are actually from companies who write great software or build great platforms, often open source. This may give you an idea of what other blogs you might want to explore, based on cool projects you've come across.

## Beyond Makers Academy

### The London developer community

One of the best features of living and studying in London is that there is **a lot** going on tech-wise. If you like beer || pizza, you're in luck - there is generally something happening at least every other night. These events are a great place to drink pizza and eat beer, and occasionally talk about code. If you don't want to go on your own, post up on Slack - you will usually find someone eager to go. Please feel free to send pull requsts to add to this list - this is only a small selection of the events out there.

- [Pivotal Lunchtime Talks](http://www.meetup.com/Pivotal-London-Talks/) - These are always fascinating, and spots tend to disappear the second they are announced. If you do get a spot, GO! Topics range from passionate debate on the future of Bitcoins to how to break through the plateaus we hit as we pursue mastery of our craft.
- [London Ruby User Group (LRUG)](http://lrug.org/) - If you aren't already attending this regularly, you should be.
- [Ruby Hacknight](http://www.meetup.com/ruby-hacknight-london/) - Brought to you by the fine folk at Yammer, this is a great place to go and pair with complete strangers. No, not like that.
- [London Node User Group (LNUG)](http://lnug.org/) - LRUG's weird little cousin. If you are slightly unhinged because you actually quite like Node, you will find others like you here. Lightning talks here have included how to use process.nextTick() to fill the event loop with animal calls, building massively distributed bingo chat systems and turning a room full of wifi enabled laptops into an ad-hoc BitTorrent-like system. You have been warned.
- [Meteor London](http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-London/) - LNUG's sensible older brother. Like LNUG, but since Meteor is a framework, people actually get sensible stuff done with it. Like build robots.
- [London Software Craftsmanship Community](http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/) - Another meetup that tends to fill up very quickly. These guys are serious about software, and they want you to come and be very serious with them too, while drinking craft beer. They even hold a specific pairing evenings, where you are expected to turn up with a particularly tough problem and solve it by the end of the evening.
- [Codebar](http://codebar.io) - Make a difference and help more underepresented groups get into tech. If you have finished Makers, you should be at a level to help as a coach - if you are less confident, they always need more people willing to teach basic HTML and CSS. If you are nervous about coaching and are eligible to attend Codebar as a student, attend once to see what it's about, then go coach. Invitations are sent out every Thursday lunchtime and disappear within the hour.
- [Nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io) - These don't happen often, but when they do, don't miss out.

### Hackathons

Hackathons are great, and if you haven't been to one, you need to. Your fellow non-Makers teammates may hate you for trying to TDD (and this may be the ONLY time we tell you it's ok to just spew code everywhere), but there is always a shortage of competent developers at hackathons who know how to solve problems with solid, working code. Admittedly, the projects with the best concept and design tend to win (depending on who is running the hackathon), but between the free t-shirts, the cocktail evenings and staying up for 48 hours staring/screaming at your screen, it's generally fun. [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/UK-Hackathons-and-Jams/) has a list of some of the more popular hackathons going on in London.

### The wider developer community

They're out there somewhere, apparently. Go find them. Start here:

- [/r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming)
- [Gitter](http://gitter.im) - Each room is built over a GitHub repo: find your favourite repos and get to meet the community.
- [24 Pull Requests](http://24pullrequests.com/) - This only happens at Christmas, but includes a lot of guidance about how to get started contributing to open source, with a list of suggested projects to get involved in. Being able to say that you've meaningfully contributed to OSS is also a big plus at interview.
- [Makers Academy Twitter list](https://twitter.com/makersacademy/lists/coolcode) - This is an ever growing list of Twitter accounts we feel are worth checking out.

### Er, this isn't fun

Some people don't enjoy constantly reading about code, and that's fine too. However, if you are aiming for a job, being aware of these resources, being able to understand the technical language used and being exposed to a wider part of the developer community will help a lot. Also, at least having some content to pretend to be enthusiastic about may help.

But in all seriousness, if you've made it through this, we can assume that you derive fun from waking up every day and learning something new. Hopefully these resources will get you started on a journey towards exploring everything that's out there, whether by yourself, or with everyone else.

And remember, if all else fails, there's alwasy [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/) for consolation:
