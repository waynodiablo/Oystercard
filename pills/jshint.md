#JSHint and 'use strict'

JavaScript can be extremely temperamental, as you may have noticed(!!). Also, a lot of the code you will see online in tutorials is not very well written. But not all is lost! There are a few tricks you can use to ensure that your code meets certain standards, throws errors when expected and is a general pleasure to read and maintain.
