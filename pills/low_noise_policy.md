# Low noise policy

On floor three and the mezzanine, there's a "low noise" policy. Programming is hard work. We want to help people concentrate at Makers.

* Please speak in a soft voice that's only audible to the people you're speaking to.

* Approach someone you want to speak to, rather than calling over.

* Set your laptop and phone on silent.

* On floor three, please take phone calls in the hallway.
