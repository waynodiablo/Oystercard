# Solution - dealing with broken bikes

[Back to the Challenge](../18_dealing_with_broken_bikes.md)

So, we have these User Stories to implement:

```
As a member of the public,
So that I reduce the chance of getting a broken bike in future,
I'd like to report a bike as broken when I return it.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations not to release broken bikes.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations to accept returning bikes (broken or not).

```

Let's start with the first one. Imagine how our manual feature test would look:

```
$ irb
2.0.0-p195 :001 > station = DockingStation.new
 => #<DockingStation:0x007fae7b3b8950>
2.0.0-p195 :002 > bike = Bike.new
 => #<Bike:0x007fae7b3c0dd0>
2.0.0-p195 :003 > bike.report_broken
 => true
2.0.0-p195 :004 > bike.broken?
 => true
2.0.0-p195 :005 > station.dock bike
 => #<Bike:2fa237227f @broken=true>
```

We should be getting used to these sorts of error messages by now:

```
2.0.0-p195 :003 > bike.report_broken
NoMethodError: undefined method `report_broken' for #<Bike:0x007fad7c030ee0>
  from (irb):8
  from /Users/tansaku/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.2/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
```

Let's implement the Unit Test for the `report_broken` method we're missing, in the `bike_spec.rb` file.

```ruby
# in bike_spec.rb
it 'can be reported broken' do
  subject.report_broken
  # let's use one of RSpec's predicate matchers
  expect(subject).to be_broken
end
```

We now have a failing unit test to match our manual feature test error:  

```
Failures:

  1) Bike can be reported broken
     Failure/Error: subject.report_broken
     NoMethodError:
       undefined method `report_broken' for #<Bike:0x007fe0b9315a50>
     # ./spec/bike_spec.rb:7:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
```

So, our implementation:

```ruby
# in bike.rb
class Bike
  def report_broken
    @broken = true
  end

  def broken?
    @broken
  end
end
```

All our specs are passing.

So, on to the next feature:

```
As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations not to release broken bikes.
```

Let's draft a feature test using `irb`:

```
$ irb
2.0.0-p195 :001 > station = DockingStation.new
 => #<DockingStation:0x007fae7b3b8950>
2.0.0-p195 :002 > bike = Bike.new
 => #<Bike:0x007fae7b3c0dd0>
2.0.0-p195 :003 > bike.report_broken
 => true
2.0.0-p195 :004 > station.dock bike
 => #<Bike:2fa237227f @broken=true>
2.0.0-p195 :005 > station.release_bike
 RuntimeError: No bikes available
  .... stack trace omitted ....
```

But at the moment our docking station will happily release a broken bike.  We have to put a stop to that. 

At this point, we're going to pull back on the solution support: it's up to you to implement the last two features, using your newfound testing skills.

Don't forget you can rely on others in your cohort and [Slack Overflow](https://github.com/makersacademy/slack-overflow) for support. When we start hitting new topics again, the solutions will kick back into action.
