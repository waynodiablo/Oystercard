# Walkthrough - limiting capacity

[Back to the Challenge](../13_limiting_capacity.md)

It's time for another User Story:

```
As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can control the distribution of bikes,
I'd like docking stations not to accept more bikes than their capacity.
```

This is a great user story to pick next as it introduces an entirely new concept to our domain: *capacity*.

Does the client want docking stations that store just 1 bike or should they store 20, 50, 100?  This would be a good time to check with the client what the storage capacity requirements are for docking stations.  Perhaps they weren't discussed in the initial client meeting.  

In the meantime, let's assume a capacity of 1.  It's a fairly unreasonable assumption; but in order to do the least amount of work to support the user story, let's create a feature test that raises an error when trying to dock a bike into a station that already has a bike.  Remember that that this involves writing out the code that we would like to be able to run in `irb`:

```sh
$ irb
2.1.5 :001 > require './lib/docking_station'
 => true
2.1.5 :002 > docking_station = DockingStation.new
 => #<DockingStation:0x007fe022230258 ...>
2.1.5 :003 > docking_station.dock Bike.new
 => #<Bike:0x007f8d7424cee0>
2.1.5 :004 > docking_station.dock Bike.new
RuntimeError: DockingStation
  .... stack trace omitted ....
```

At current, our manual feature test is not raising the error we want. Let's represent this at the Unit level:

```ruby
# in docking_station_spec.rb
describe DockingStation do
  # other tests omitted for brevity

  describe '#dock' do
    it 'raises an error when full' do
      subject.dock(Bike.new)
      expect { subject.dock Bike.new }.to raise_error 'Docking station full'
    end
  end
end
```

Now we have matching errors at the Feature and Unit levels, let's Implement a solution:

```ruby
# in docking_station.rb
class DockingStation
  def dock(bike)
    fail 'Docking station full' if @bike
    @bike = bike
  end

  def release_bike
    fail 'No bikes available' unless @bike
    @bike
  end
end
```

We have now implemented the required feature. Nice job!
