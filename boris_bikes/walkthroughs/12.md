# Walkthrough - raising Exceptions

[Back to the Challenge](../12_raising_exceptions.md)

Let's start with our User Story:

```
As a member of the public,
So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,
I'd like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.
```

We can interpret this User Story into a 'manual feature test'. For simplicity, we'll expect an exception to be raised when there are no bikes available.  Something like this perhaps:

```sh
$ irb
2.1.5 :001 > require './lib/docking_station'
 => true
2.1.5 :002 > docking_station = DockingStation.new
 => #<DockingStation:0x007fe022230258 ...>
2.1.5 :003 > docking_station.release_bike
RuntimeError: No bikes available
  .... stack trace omitted ....
```

> Getting bored of all these 'manual' feature tests? Try creating a `feature_spec.rb` file inside your `spec` directory and putting your feature tests in there instead. No more guidance on this one for now ;)

At the moment, we don't get this error. Instead, we just get a brand new `Bike` instance, because of our `release_bike` method on `DockingStation` instances:

```ruby
def release_bike
  Bike.new
end
```

We need to make a decision about our program now. Should docking stations:

1. Start empty, or
2. Start containing a bike?

This is the kind of decision we'd make in consultation with a client. However, it seems a reasonable assumption that docking stations will start empty, so let's go with that for the time being. This assumption implies that we'll need to change our earlier user story regarding the `release_bike` method to ensure that there is a bike to hand out to the first user. Let's update our unit tests, like we did in the previous challenge:

```ruby
# in docking_station_spec.rb
describe DockingStation do
  # let's upgrade our syntax, to:
  # use a '#' before a method name
  # to imply that it is an instance
  # method. Also look: nested describes!
  describe '#release_bike' do
    it 'releases a bike' do
      bike = Bike.new
      subject.dock(bike)
      # we want to release the bike we docked
      expect(subject.release_bike).to eq bike
    end
  end
end
```

Now, modifying our `release_bike` implementation:

```ruby
# in docking_station.rb
def release_bike
  @bike
end
```

> You might notice that this doesn't actually 'release' the bike - rather, it acts as an _aliased_ attribute reader. As yet, we haven't hit any User Stories that require us to remove bikes when they are released, so we'll leave this for now.

OK, `rspec` passes. Now back to the feature test we want:

```sh
$ irb
2.1.5 :001 > require './lib/docking_station'
 => true
2.1.5 :002 > docking_station = DockingStation.new
 => #<DockingStation:0x007fe022230258 ...>
2.1.5 :003 > docking_station.release_bike
RuntimeError: No bikes available
  .... stack trace omitted ....
```

Let's add a unit test to our DockingStation spec to check that an explicit error is raised when the station is empty.

```ruby
require 'docking_station'

describe DockingStation do
  # other tests omitted for brevity

  describe '#release_bike' do
    it 'raises an error when there are no bikes available' do
      # Let's not dock a bike first:
      # remember subject == DockingStation.new
      expect { subject.release_bike }.to raise_error 'No bikes available'
    end
  end
end
```

Notice also the nested `describe` block.  Why have we introduced this?  Until now, we have been describing behaviour in a general sense.  However, we are now describing behaviour *specific to a particular method*.  By nesting this in another `describe` block, we are able to DRY out our descriptions.

Again we now have a match between our manual feature test and our unit test.  Our manual irb test for our second feature is failing to raise an error and our unit test is failing for the same reason; the absence of an error.  Now, finally, we can change some production code.  We can do the following:

```ruby
class DockingStation
  # other methods omitted for brevity
  def release_bike
    fail 'No bikes available' unless @bike
    @bike
  end
end
```

> Notice how we put the error-catching line - which uses `fail` - first in the method. This is a pattern known as a 'guard condition'. By catching errors as the first priority, errors cannot progress further into the program. It's a great pattern.

Ta-da! Our `rspec` tests pass, and so do our `irb` feature tests. Time for a refactor step, and let's check our User Story:

```
As a member of the public,
So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,
I'd like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.
```

It seems like we have a reasonable solution.

> Notice how the design of `DockingStation` and `Bike` has *emerged*.  We haven't directly considered the design of these classes at all - they have simply emerged from our tests.  This is a powerful feature of TDD and while there might seem like a lot of to-ing and fro-ing initially, we are constantly learning about the domain and finding the simplest way to model it.
