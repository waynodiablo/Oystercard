### Password Recovery

A user should be able to request a password reset from the sign-in page which will ask them to enter email address.

```ruby
feature 'Resetting Password' do
 scenario 'When I forget my password I can see a link to reset' do
   visit '/sessions/new'
   click_link 'I forgot my password'
   expect(page).to have_content("Please enter your email address")
 end
end
```

We create the link for requesting a password recovery.

```ruby
 # app/views/sessions/new.erb
 ...
 
 <a href="/users/recover">I forgot my password</a>
```

In the controller all we need to do is display the expected message to pass the test.

```ruby
  # app/controllers/users.rb
  ...
  
  get '/users/recover' do
    "Please enter your email address"
  end
```

The tests should now pass.

The page needs to allow the user to submit their email address for recovery. For security reasons we always want to display the "Please check your inbox" message, even if the user doesn't exist. This stops people from being able to know if you are signed up to a website by trying to recover your password.

```ruby
scenario 'When I enter my email I am told to check my inbox' do
   visit '/users/recover'
   fill_in :email, with: "alice@example.com"
   click_button "Submit"
   expect(page).to have_content "Thanks, Please check your inbox for the link."
 end
 ```
 
```html
# app/views/users/recover.erb
   
<form action="/users/recover" method="post">
   <label for="email"> Please enter your email address
     <input type="email" name="email" required>
     <input type="submit" value="Submit">
   </label>
</form>
```
 
```ruby
  # app/controllers/users.erb
 
  post '/users/recover' do
    erb :'users/acknowledgement'
  end
```

```html
# app/views/users/acknowledgement

Thanks, Please check your inbox for the link.
```
 
Because we're now repeating ourselves by clicking on the links, we'll now change it to a method to dry up our code.
We also test for a password token being set on the user, when a recovery request is submitted.

```ruby
 scenario 'When I enter my email I am told to check my inbox' do
   recover_password
   expect(page).to have_content "Thanks, Please check your inbox for the link."
 end
 
  scenario 'assigned a reset token to the user when they recover' do
    sign_up
    expect{recover_password}.to change{User.first.password_token}
  end
 
  def recover_password
    visit '/users/recover'
    fill_in :email, with: "alice@example.com"
    click_button "Submit"
  end
```
 
 We need to add `password_token` as a property on the User model.
 ```ruby
   # models/users.rb
   ...
   
   property :password_token, Text
 ```
 
 We now generate a token in the controller, using a `generate_token` method which we need to create.
 
 ```ruby
   # controllers/users.rb
   post '/users/recover' do
     user = User.first(email: params[:email])
     if user
       user.generate_token
     end
     
     erb :'users/acknowledgment'
   end
 ```
 
 We're going to create a unit test for generating a token. All we care about now is that it changes, and we can worry about the implementation later.
 
```ruby
it "saves a password recovery token when we generate a token" do
   expect{user.generate_token}.to change{user.password_token}
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
require 'securerandom'
...

def generate_token
  self.password_token = SecureRandom.hex
  self.save
end
```

We've used SecureRandom as it securely generates a random string better than we could manually.
 
Now both the tests should pass.
 
Now is a good time extract out some of the setup into a before block. We know that if a user will reset their password that they have previously signed up, and we clear their session so they are not signed in. This will help us construct our tests.
  
 ```ruby
 # spec/reset_password_spec.rb
 
 before do 
   sign_up
   Capybara.reset!
 end
 let(:user) { User.first }
```

We want the token to only work for a set amount of time (e.g. 1 hour). For this test we'll be using Timecop to freeze and move forward in time:

```ruby
#Gemfile
gem 'timecop'
```

```ruby
# spec/reset_password_spec.rb

scenario 'it doesn\'t allow you to use the token after an hour' do
  recover_password
  Timecop.travel(60 * 60 * 60) do
    visit("/users/reset_password?token=#{user.password_token}")
    expect(page).to have_content "Your token is invalid"
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/user.rb
get '/users/reset_password' do
    "Your token is invalid"
end
```

Although the time is set in the future it's quite easy for us to slime this test and make it pass. Now we need to implement the inverse test to validate a valid token. 

If the token is valid, the user should be shown a page that asks them to enter a new password.

```ruby
# spec/reset_password_spec.rb

scenario 'it asks for your new password when your token is valid' do
   recover_password
   visit("/users/reset_password?token=#{user.password_token}")
   expect(page).to have_content("Please enter your new password")
 end
```

In order to make this work we need to store a timestamp on the user model and create page which accepts a parameter of the token for the user (where the user gets the link from we'll defer to later).

```ruby
# spec/models/user_spec.rb

it "saves a password recovery token time when we generate a token using" do
  Timecop.freeze do
    user.generate_token
    expect(user.password_token_time).to eq Time.now
  end
end
```

```ruby
# models/user.rb
property :password_token_time, Time
...

def generate_token
  self.password_token = SecureRandom.hex
  self.password_token_time = Time.now
  self.save
end
```

Now we have the timestamp changed we need to be able to retrieve a user based on the a valid token. If they have a valid token we should be able to get the user and if the token is invalid (e.g. an hour in the future) we shoudn't return a user. For this we can write a unit test.

```ruby

# spec/models/user_spec.rb

it 'can find a user with a valid token' do
   user.generate_token
   expect(User.find_by_valid_token(user.password_token)).to eq user
 end
```

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

def self.find_by_valid_token(token)
  first(password_token: token)
end
```

Now we're going to set it to an hour in the future and this time we shouldn't retrieve a user. 

```ruby

# spec/models/user_spec.rb
 it 'can\'t find a user with a token over 1 hour in the future' do
   user.generate_token
   Timecop.travel(60 * 60 + 1) do
    expect(User.find_by_valid_token(user.password_token)).to eq nil
   end
 end
```

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

def self.find_by_valid_token(token)
  user = first(password_token: token)
  if (user && user.password_token_time + (60 * 60) > Time.now)
    user
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/user.rb
get '/users/reset_password' do
  @user = User.find_by_valid_token(params[:token])
  if(@user)
    "Please enter your new password"
  else
    "Your token is invalid"
  end
end
```

The tests should now pass.

Now we redirect to a page where the user can update their password.

```ruby
# spec/reset_password_spec.rb

scenario 'it lets you enter a new password with a valid token' do
  recover_password
  visit("/users/reset_password?token=#{user.password_token}")
  fill_in :password, with: "newpassword"
  fill_in :password_confirmation, with: "newpassword"
  click_button "Submit"
  expect(page).to have_content("Please sign in")
end
```

We render the new `reset_password` view:

```ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb

get '/users/reset_password' do
  @user = User.find_by_valid_token(params[:token])
  if(@user)
    erb :'users/reset_password'
  else
    "Your token is invalid"
  end
end
```

```ruby
# views/user/reset_password.rb

<h1>Please enter your new password</h1>

<form action='/users' method='post'>
 <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="patch">
 <label for='password'>
   Password: <input name='password' type='password'>
 </label>
 <label for='password_confirmation'>
   Password Confirmation: <input name='password_confirmation' type='password'>
 </label>
 <input type='submit' value='Submit'>
</form>
```

Note that we're using the `patch` method, because we're updating an existing resource.
The form does a patch request to a `/users` page so we create that:

```ruby
  # app/controllers/users.rb
  patch '/users' do
    redirect "/sessions/new"
  end
```

The tests should now pass.

We now need to test that the password works, so we need to implement the functionality that changes the password.

```ruby 
# spec/reset_password_spec.rb

scenario 'it lets you sign in after password reset' do
   recover_password
   visit("/users/reset_password?token=#{user.password_token}")
   fill_in :password, with: "newpassword"
   fill_in :password_confirmation, with: "newpassword"
   click_button "Submit"
   sign_in(email: "alice@example.com", password: "newpassword")
   expect(page).to have_content "Welcome, alice@example.com"
 end
 ```
 
 ```ruby
 # app/controllers/users.rb
 
 patch '/users' do
   user = User.find_by_valid_token(params[:token])
   user.update(password: params[:password], password_confirmation: params[:password_confirmation])
   redirect "/sessions/new"
 end
 ```

The tests should now pass.

Now we are going to double check that we can't reset the password if the confirmation doesn't match

```ruby
# spec/reset_password_spec.rb

scenario 'it lets you know if you\'re passwords don\'t match' do
   recover_password
   visit("/users/reset_password?token=#{user.password_token}")
   fill_in :password, with: "newpassword"
   fill_in :password_confirmation, with: "wrongpassword"
   click_button "Submit"
   expect(page).to have_content("Password does not match the confirmation")
 end
 ```
 
 ```ruby
 # app/controllers/users.rb
 patch '/users' do
   user = User.find_by_valid_token(params[:token])
   if user.update(password: params[:password], password_confirmation: params[:password_confirmation])
     redirect "/sessions/new"
   else
     flash.now[:errors] = user.errors.full_messages
     erb :'users/reset_password'
   end
 end
 ```
