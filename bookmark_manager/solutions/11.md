# Solution

[Back to Challenge](../11_creating_links.md)

`creating_links_spec.rb` should look like this:

```ruby
feature 'Creating links' do

  scenario 'I can create a new link' do
    visit '/links/new'
    fill_in 'url',   with: 'http://www.zombo.com/'
    fill_in 'title', with: 'This is Zombocom'
    click_button 'Create link'

    # we expect to be redirected back to the links page
    expect(current_path).to eq '/links'

    within 'ul#links' do
      expect(page).to have_content('This is Zombocom')
    end
  end
end
```

The above test should fail as follows:

```sh
Failure/Error: fill_in 'url', with: 'http://www.zombo.com'
Capybara::ElementNotFound:
  Unable to find field "url"
````

Define a GET '/links/new' route in app.rb

```ruby
get '/links/new' do
  erb :'links/new'
end
```

Create an associated view containing a form that POSTs to `/links` in `views/links/new.erb`

```html
<h1> New Link </h1>

<form action='/links' method='POST'>
  <label for='title'>
    Title:
    <input type='text' name='title' />
  </label>
  <label for='url'>
    URL:
    <input type='text' name='url' />
  </label>
  <input type='submit' value='Create link'>

</form>
```

Though we have a form for creating links, nothing is being done with the information the user has submitted. Within app.rb, define a route to receive the form data:

```ruby
post '/links' do
  Link.create(url: params[:url], title: params[:title])
  redirect to('/links')
end
```

We are declaring `post /links` rather than `post /links/new` because we are following RESTful conventions. In our case, GET links should return a list of links, while POST links should create a new link, while GET links/new is getting a form for creating a new link.
