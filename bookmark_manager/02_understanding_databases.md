## Understanding databases

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

In order to support the user stories created in the first challenge, we'll need a method to **persist** data beyond a single session of use. There are many ways to do this, but one common approach is to use a **Relational Database Management System** (**RDBMS**)

## Learning Objectives covered

* Define 'persistence' as the storage of information long-term
* Contrast database persistence with session persistence and persistence on the filesystem
* Describe the structure of a database, referencing 'tables' and 'rows'
* Define 'PostgreSQL' as 'a particular type of relational database'

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Research the relative merits of Relational databases vs NoSQL databases or flat files
- [ ] Write a blog post with your partner on the above
