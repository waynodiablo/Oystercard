## Viewing Bookmarks

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md#challenges)

Now we've set up our basic web app we can start implementing features! So let's implement our first feature, **viewing bookmarks**.


## Learning Objectives covered

* Test driving development of a web application.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Write a failing feature test for viewing bookmarks at the `/bookmarks` route.
- [ ] Pass the feature test in the simplest way possible.
- [ ] Refactor the code to use the View and Controller.
- [ ] Test drive a refactor of the code to use a Model, that returns the list of bookmarks.

> You'll probably want to create a `Bookmark` model that responds to the class method `.all` with a hard-coded array of `Bookmark` instances.
