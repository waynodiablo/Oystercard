# Walkthrough - Manipulating Table Data

[Back to Challenge](../05_manipulating_table_data.md)

 Let's list all the existing students:

    $ SELECT * FROM students;

This command displays all columns from the table "students" and shows us an empty table:

    id | name
    ----+------
    (0 rows)

Let's add some data:

    $ INSERT INTO students (name)
    VALUES ('Lori');

Let's add some more:

    $ INSERT INTO students (name)
    VALUES ('Alex');

> Always **sanity-check** the steps you take! For instance, here you can run a quick `SELECT` command to check that your data was inserted correctly. Note how each new student we added takes up one **database row**. So we have tables, columns, and rows: take a moment to explain what each thing does to your pair.

To delete a row from a database table, we can do the following:

    $ DELETE FROM students WHERE name = 'Lori';

To update a table row, we can do this:

    UPDATE students SET name = 'Jordan' WHERE name = 'Alex';

> Don't forget to **sanity-check** everything you've done before moving on!
