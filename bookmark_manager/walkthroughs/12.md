## Walkthrough – CRUD

[Back to Challenge](../12_deleting_bookmarks.md)

**CRUD** is an acronym for the four 'basic functions' of persistent storage:

- **Creating** data
- **Reading** data
- **Updating** data
- **Deleting** data

## 1. Deleting Bookmarks

> Prefer to read the code directly? You can check out the entire commit [here](https://github.com/soph-g/bookmark-manager-example/commit/1190542d2fff26b9d24ea742d55fcb807c0bbca3).

Here's our requirement:

* Delete Bookmarks

Here's a User Story for that requirement:

```
As a user
So I can remove my bookmark from Bookmark Manager
I want to delete a bookmark
```

Here's the user flow for deleting a bookmark:

1. Visit the homepage.
2. Click a 'delete' button next to a bookmark.
3. See the homepage, without that bookmark.

Here's that flow in Capybara terms:

```ruby
# in spec/features/deleting_a_bookmark_spec.rb

feature 'Deleting a bookmark' do
  scenario 'A user can delete a bookmark' do
    Bookmark.create(url: 'http://www.makersacademy.com', title: 'Makers Academy')
    visit('/bookmarks')
    expect(page).to have_link('Makers Academy', href: 'http://www.makersacademy.com')

    first('.bookmark').click_button 'Delete'

    expect(current_path).to eq '/bookmarks'
    expect(page).not_to have_link('Makers Academy', href: 'http://www.makersacademy.com')
  end
end
```

In this test we are:

1. Setting up test data
2. Checking that the data is present
3. Carrying out the DELETE action
4. Checking that the data has been removed

You can find out more about good steps for setting up and running tests here: [thoughtbot Four-Phase Test](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/four-phase-test).

> I've used Capybara's `first` method to click the Delete button inside the first element with class 'bookmark'.

When we run this test it fails:

```sh
1) Deleting a bookmark A user can delete a bookmark
   Failure/Error: first('.bookmark').click_button 'Delete'

   Capybara::ExpectationNotMet:
     expected to find visible css ".bookmark" at least 1 time but there were no matches
```

This is because we haven't added the bookmark class to the html list item, or the `Delete` button to `index.erb`, yet. Let's do that now:

```html
<ul>
  <% @bookmarks.each do |bookmark| %>
    <li class="bookmark" id="bookmark-<%= bookmark.id %>">
      <a href="<%= bookmark.url %>" target="_blank">
        <%= bookmark.title %>
      </a>
      <input type="submit" value="Delete" />
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

Run the test again, and we have a new fail - this time because this button doesn't do anything. Let's wrap it in a form:

```html
<ul>
  <% @bookmarks.each do |bookmark| %>
    <li id="bookmark-<%= bookmark.id %>">
      <a href="<%= bookmark.url %>" target="_blank">
        <%= bookmark.title %>
      </a>
      <form action="/bookmarks/<%= bookmark.id %>" method="post">
        <input type='hidden' name='_method' value='DELETE'/>
        <input type="submit" value="Delete" />
      </form>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

> We had to do something a bit 'hacky' to delete a record whilst maintaining RESTfulness.  Read more [here](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/114156/why-are-there-are-no-put-and-delete-methods-on-html-forms).

Now our form submits! But 'Sinatra doesn't know this ditty'.

We need to build a route for our Delete button to submit to, in `app.rb`, and enable `:method_override` (if you are using `Sinatra::Base`) so we can use the `DELETE` method. You can find out a little bit more about why this change is needed [here](http://sinatrarb.com/configuration.html)

```ruby
# in app.rb

enable :sessions, :method_override

delete '/bookmarks/:id' do
  # let's print out the form params
  p params
end
```

What do we do in this route? We'd like something like `Bookmark.delete` to happen, and we need to know which bookmark to delete. Handily, we can get this information from the params, when the test is run you should see something like this in the output:

```
{"id"=>"1", "_method" => "DELETE"}
```

We can use this to write the SQL to delete the bookmark with that ID, and redirect:

```ruby
# in app.rb

delete '/bookmarks/:id' do
  connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager_test')
  connection.exec("DELETE FROM bookmarks WHERE id = #{params['id']}")
  redirect '/bookmarks'
end
```

Now that our test passes, let's move the SQL into the `Bookmark` model. Start with a spec for `Bookmark.delete`:

```ruby
# in spec/bookmark_spec.rb

describe '.delete' do
  it 'deletes the given bookmark' do
    bookmark = Bookmark.create(title: 'Makers Academy', url: 'http://www.makersacademy.com')

    Bookmark.delete(id: bookmark.id)

    expect(Bookmark.all.length).to eq 0
  end
end
```

And code that looks something like:

```ruby
# in lib/bookmark.rb

class Bookmark
  def self.delete(id:)
    if ENV['ENVIRONMENT'] == 'test'
      connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager_test')
    else
      connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager')
    end
    connection.exec("DELETE FROM bookmarks WHERE id = #{id}")
  end

  ### rest of the class ###
end
```

Our unit test passes, so we can rewrite the controller action:

```ruby
# in app.rb

delete '/bookmarks/:id' do
  Bookmark.delete(id: params[:id])
  redirect '/bookmarks'
end
```

All tests pass: we've delivered the feature!
