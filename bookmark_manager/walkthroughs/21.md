# Walkthrough

[Back to Challenge](../21_password_confirmation.md)

Let's start by creating a test for password confirmation within `spec/features/user_management_spec.rb`.

```ruby
feature 'User sign up' do

  scenario 'requires a matching confirmation password' do
    # again it's questionable whether we should be testing the model at this
    # level.  We are mixing integration tests with feature tests.
    # However, it's convenient for our purposes.
    expect { sign_up(password_confirmation: 'wrong') }.not_to change(User, :count)
  end

  def sign_up(email: 'alice@example.com',
              password: '12345678',
              password_confirmation: '12345678')
    visit '/users/new'
    fill_in :email, with: email
    fill_in :password, with: password
    fill_in :password_confirmation, with: password_confirmation
    click_button 'Sign up'
  end

end
```

Now both user tests fail after adding the correct sign_up method with:

```
Failure/Error: fill_in :password_confirmation, with: password_confirmation
    Capybara::ElementNotFound:
      Unable to find field :password_confirmation
```

We can fix this like so:

```html
<h1>Please sign up</h1>

<form action='/users' method='post'>
  <label for='email'>
    Email: <input name='email' type='text'>
  </label>
  <label for='password'>
    Password: <input name='password' type='password'>
  </label>
  <label for='password_confirmation'>
    Password: <input name='password_confirmation' type='password'>
  </label>
  <input type='submit' value='Sign up'>
</form>
```

This should lead to this failure:

```
1) User sign up requires a matching confirmation password
   Failure/Error: expect { sign_up(password_confirmation: 'wrong') }.not_to change(User, :count)
     expected #count not to have changed, but did change from 0 to 1
   # ./spec/features/user_management_spec.rb:19:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
```

So now our form is working and we need to implement the password confirmation functionality at a lower level in user.rb:

```ruby
  attr_reader :password
  attr_accessor :password_confirmation

  # validates_confirmation_of is a DataMapper method
  # provided especially for validating confirmation passwords!
  # The model will not save unless both password
  # and password_confirmation are the same
  # read more about it in the documentation
  # http://datamapper.org/docs/validations.html
  validates_confirmation_of :password
```

What is the relationship between `password`, `password_confirmation` and `password_digest`?  Discuss this with your pair partner.  Consider the reasons for each being defined differently with `attr_reader`, `attr_accessor` and `property` respectively.  Discuss how `validates_confirmation_of :password` might work.

However the test will still fail with:

```
1) User sign up requires a matching confirmation password
   Failure/Error: expect { sign_up(password_confirmation: 'wrong') }.not_to change(User, :count)
     expected #count not to have changed, but did change from 0 to 1
   # ./spec/features/user_management_spec.rb:19:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
```

We also need to pass the password_confirmation through to the User.create method.

```ruby
post '/users' do
  user = User.create(email: params[:email],
                     password: params[:password],
                     password_confirmation: params[:password_confirmation])
  session[:user_id] = user.id
  redirect to('/links')
end
```

However this is still not enough. It turns out the validation only works if a password is provided. We have an `attr_reader :password`, but we aren't setting `@password` at any point, so that attribute is always `nil`:

```ruby
def password=(password)
  self.password_digest = BCrypt::Password.create(password)
end
```

Because we have a custom writer for this property, we'll never be storing the plain text password in an instance variable and datamapper will be unable to compare it to the password confirmation. Let's fix it by modifying our writer:

```ruby
def password=(password)
  @password = password
  self.password_digest = BCrypt::Password.create(password)
end
```

Our test finally passes. Don't forget to test the functionality manually and deploy to heroku and do the same online.
