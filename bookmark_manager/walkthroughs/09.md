# Walkthrough

[Back to Challenge](../09_creating_a_link_model.md)

We have a failing feature test, because we don't have a `Link` class in our application: let's solve that.

Let's create the first model in `/app/models/link.rb`:

```ruby
require 'data_mapper'
require 'dm-postgres-adapter'

# This class corresponds to a table in the database
class Link

  # add DataMapper functionality to this class so it can communicate with the database
  include DataMapper::Resource

  # these property declarations set the column headers in the 'links' table
  property :id,     Serial # Serial means that it will be auto-incremented for every record
  property :title,  String
  property :url,    String

end

# Now let's set up a connection with a database
DataMapper.setup(:default, "postgres://localhost/bookmark_manager_test")
# Let's check that everything we wrote in our models was OK
DataMapper.finalize
# And let's build any new columns or tables we added
DataMapper.auto_upgrade!
```

> Having all the setup, finalizing, and upgrading in a class declaration file feels dirty. Can you think of a better place to put this stuff?

This class prescribes a relationship between a table in the database (which will be called 'links') and the `Link` class. An instance of the `Link` class is mapped to one row of the 'links' table.

Also make sure to require the link model in your tests - for instance, you could `require` it in your `spec_helper`, which is itself `require`d into every test:

```ruby
# in spec/spec_helper.rb

require './app/models/link'

# More code
```

> How does RSpec know to `require` the `spec_helper.rb` in every test?

Running our tests now should kick up the following error:
```rspec
Failures:

 1) Viewing links I can see existing links on the links page
    Failure/Error: visit '/links'
    ArgumentError:
      rack-test requires a rack application, but none was given
    # ./spec/features/viewing_links_spec.rb:4:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.00136 seconds (files took 0.37153 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure
```

Great! Our test is failing because we haven't built a controller yet: so we cannot visit the `/` route.
