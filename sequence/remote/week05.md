#### Weekend Challenge
CHOOSE EITHER (or do both if you are keen!):
- [Frontman Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/frontman-challenge) - this will help you develop your front end skills
- [Bowling Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/bowling-challenge) - this will focus on business logic / OOD

Note - you have TWO weekends to spend on this (so no code review on Monday of week 6). We recommend you do as much as you can on the first weekend.
