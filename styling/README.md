# Styling

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a bit weird, but it's perfectly understandable once you've got the basics down. After that, it's a matter of: 

1. Remembering a bunch of properties and how to use them.
2. Knowing how to work with text and positioning.
3. Using some relevant pre-processor tools to make CSS much better to work with and more powerful.
4. Being disciplined with patterns and approaches.

1/ is mostly covered [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/css.md). If you're totally unfamiliar with CSS, start there. If you're familiar with the syntax and a dozen or so properties, start here.

In this module, we're going to introduce:

- [CSS for typography](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/styling/1_css_for_typography.md)
